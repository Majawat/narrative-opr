      "description": "As the armies deployed without the luxury of ambush, tension immediately gripped the field. Alex's Roughnecks opened the engagement with a missile salvo—one stray shot missing its mark but still tearing through three of Claire's smaller units. In response, Claire advanced her mysterious \"braken thing\" while Cody's Ashen Pact defenders rushed forward to meet the threat.\n\nIn Turn 2, Alex's front-line force moved up, unleashing 20 shots at a psychic target. Although only two connected—costing him one \"little guy\"—Claire's forces countered by advancing her Emerald Tide, prompting Cody to reposition his Dustborn to block the assault.\n\nAs the battle wore on, turrets were fired upon, Zerek Thal and beast riders repositioned for cover, and psychic powers clashed with raw firepower. In one unforgettable moment amid the chaos, a Roughneck model literally runs like a bitch in a desperate bid to close the gap—a vivid reminder of the unpredictable nature of war."

      "description": "Just when the battle reached its boiling point, an alien cannon emerged—a weapon as enigmatic as it was devastating. In a movie-esque climax, Cody's final, decisive shot obliterated Alex's tank. Even so, in a display of raw survival instinct, the crew managed to leap clear of the explosion at the last second.\n\nThis day of clashing titans, strategic gambits, and moments of absurdity will be remembered—especially that unforgettable instance when someone runs like a bitch."
