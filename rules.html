      <h2>Activation</h2>
      <p>
        The player picks one unit that hasn't activated yet, and it must take
        one action:
      </p>
      <table
        class="table table-striped table-hover table-dark table-bordered table-sm table-responsive"
      >
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Move</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Hold</td>
            <td>0"</td>
            <td>Can shoot</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Advance</td>
            <td>6"</td>
            <td>Can shoot after move</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Rush</td>
            <td>12"</td>
            <td>Can't shoot</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Charge</td>
            <td>12"</td>
            <td>Moves into melee</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h2>Shooting</h2>
      <p>
        Models in range and line of sight may fire all ranged weapons, and may
        fire at up to two different targets with different weapon types.
        Shooting models take one quality test per attack, and each success is a
        hit. For each hit defending units roll one die trying to score their
        Defense value or higher to block, and each fail causes one wound. For
        each wound, the defender must remove one model.
      </p>
      <h2>Melee</h2>
      <p>
        Charging models must move into base contact with targets, or as close as
        possible, and then defenders must do the same by moving up to 3". Models
        within 2" horizontally and 4" vertically of enemies must strike with all
        melee weapons, which works like shooting. Then defenders may choose to
        strike back, but don't have to. Once both units are done, the losing
        unit must take a morale test (see morale section). If one of the units
        is destroyed, the other may move by up to 3", else chargers must move
        back and separate by 1" (if possible).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fatigue:</strong> After charging or striking back, units only
        hit on unmodified results of 6 in melee until the end of that round.
      </p>
      <h2>Morale</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Morale Tests:</strong> At the end of an activation where wounds
        leave a unit with half or less of its total size or tough value (for
        single-model units), or it loses a melee, the unit must take a morale
        test. To take a morale test, take a quality test, and if failed the unit
        is Shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Shaken:</strong> Must stay idle, counts as fatigued, always
        fails morale tests, and can't contest or seize objectives. Shaken units
        must spend one full activation idle to stop being Shaken.
      </p>
      <h2>Terrain</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Cover Terrain:</strong> Units with most models fully inside
        cover terrain or behind sight blockers, or that are mostly inside cover
        terrain or behind sight blockers (for single-model units), get +1 to
        Defense rolls when blocking hits from shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong> Units moving through difficult
        terrain at any point can't move more than 6" at a time in total.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dangerous Terrain:</strong> Models moving across dangerous
        terrain, or that activate in it, must roll one die (or as many as their
        tough value), and for each roll of 1 the unit takes a wound.
