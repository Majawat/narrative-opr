      <h1>Story</h1>
      <p>
        An ancient alien machine, known only as the Mechanist Nexus, has begun
        to awaken from its long slumber on a forgotten world. It is said to hold
        secrets of both technological and arcane power that could shift the
        balance of the galaxy. The Robot Legion, driven by an obsession with
        their mechanical perfection, seeks to control the Nexus. However, the
        Nexus seems to be reacting to the presence of other forces in the
        galaxy, triggering strange phenomena and corrupting the environment
        around it.

      <p>
        [Here are where the specific rules we'll be following will be. Work in
        progress]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Campaign length is Game-Limited</strong>. We will play 10
          games. Once each month starting in February and ending in November.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Army Sheet:</strong> Each army and unit must be given a
          <em>unique name</em>, which you can edit on your Army List.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Army Point Limits:</strong> there is no upper bound of
          available points, however no army may bring over 250pts more than the
          army with the lowest point value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Underdog Bonus:</strong> Any army that has a point value lower
          than at least one other gets an underdog bonus. You get 1 underdog
          point for every 50pts difference between your army and the one with
          the highest value. Each underdog point can be spent to modify all dice
          in a friendly or enemy roll by +1 or -1, but only one point can be
          spent per roll.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special Objectives:</strong> In addition to the mission
          objectives, players may earn a bonus of 75pts by completing special
          objectives. Roll one die each to see which objective you get:

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                A mysterious signal emanates from an ancient and forgotten
                world. It leads to a tomb-like structure, deep beneath a
                planet's surface, said to be a precursor to the Mechanist Nexus.
                This ancient site is vital to unlocking the secrets of the
                Nexus, and now multiple factions have converged to claim it for
                their own purposes. The battle begins as factions scramble to
                unearth the tomb's entrance and secure its treasures before they
                are all lost.
              </p>

              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>
                Each faction races to claim the artifacts inside the tomb, which
                hold the key to accessing the Mechanist Nexus. The first team to
                capture and extract the Tomb Artifact from the center of the
                battlefield wins. The Tomb Artifact is a special objective
                marker that must be carried to a faction's deployment zone.
              </p>
              <h3>Special Rules</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tomb of Secrets:</strong> The Tomb Artifact is hidden
                  in the center of the battlefield within a piece of dense
                  terrain (such as a crumbling ruin or ancient control room).
                  When any unit enters this terrain, they must roll a D6:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    On a 4+, the player finds the Artifact and can pick it up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On a 1-3, a random malfunction occurs (players roll a D6 for
                    a random event):
                  </li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Crumbling Terrain:</strong> The terrain becomes
                      difficult to move through for the rest of the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Tech Surge:</strong> A nearby machine becomes
                      active and shoots at the unit that touched the artifact,
                      dealing a D6 damage to one model in that unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Cloak of Darkness:</strong> The unit is
                      disoriented and must reroll their next action with a -1
                      modifier.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>No Reinforcements:</strong> For this mission, no
                  reserve units can be called in. Players must fight with what
                  they deploy at the start of the battle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Neutral Forces:</strong> There are automated sentries
                  patrolling the tomb, which will attack any unit (friend or
                  foe) if they come within 6" of them. These sentries are
                  treated as a neutral enemy force. They are not controlled by
                  any player but will target the nearest unit, following normal
                  targeting rules.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Terrain Suggestions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Shifting Ground:</strong> A large area of the board
                  with unstable or shifting terrain that could block movement or
                  line of sight at various points. This represents the volatile
                  energy caused by the Nexus's awakening.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Damaged Power Relays:</strong> These relays (which are
                  the Power Nodes) look like mechanical structures overrun with
                  cables and flickering energy. They provide cover but also
                  represent the unstable power of the Nexus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ruins of a Fallen City:</strong> Some areas of the
                  battlefield are filled with wreckage from long-gone cities,
                  where ancient technology remains active.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Deployment</h3>
              <p>
                Each player sets up their forces in their respective quarter.
                The center of the battlefield contains the "Tomb Artifact," an
                important objective marker located within the Ancient Control
                Room.
              </p>
              <h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
              <p>
                The first player to extract the Tomb Artifact to their
                deployment zone wins the mission.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Victory:</strong> The winning player gains access to
                  the first piece of the Mechanist Nexus data and can upgrade
                  one unit in their army (this could be a small, lore-based
                  boost like better tech, weapons, or leadership abilities).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Defeat:</strong> The losing player suffers a
                  significant delay in their plans, losing one unit permanently
                  (a single unit is removed from their army list). The winner's
                  success increases the likelihood of the Nexus activating
                  earlier, which will influence the second mission.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                The Tomb Artifact has been secured, but the action has caused
                the ancient mechanisms of the tomb to stir to life, triggering
                environmental chaos. The Nexus is beginning to wake, and
                dangerous, volatile terrain has begun to affect the battlefield.
                The factions are forced to confront one another in a skirmish,
                as the storm of mechanical and environmental chaos grows
                stronger.
              </p>

              <h3>Objective</h3>
              <p>
                The factions must control specific locations that are connected
                to the Nexus activation. These are Power Nodes that fuel the
                activation process. Each faction wants to control them to
                prevent their enemies from accessing them, or to secure their
                position for future advantage.
              </p>
