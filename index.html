      <h1>Story</h1>
      <p>
        An ancient alien machine, known only as the Mechanist Nexus, has begun
        to awaken from its long slumber on a forgotten world. It is said to hold
        secrets of both technological and arcane power that could shift the
        balance of the galaxy. The Robot Legion, driven by an obsession with
        their mechanical perfection, seeks to control the Nexus. However, the
        Nexus seems to be reacting to the presence of other forces in the
        galaxy, triggering strange phenomena and corrupting the environment
        around it.

      <a name="mission1"><h2>Mission 1: The Unearthed Tomb</h2></a>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        A mysterious signal emanates from an ancient and forgotten world. It
        leads to a tomb-like structure, deep beneath a planet's surface, said to
        be a precursor to the Mechanist Nexus. This ancient site is vital to
        unlocking the secrets of the Nexus, and now multiple factions have
        converged to claim it for their own purposes. The battle begins as
        factions scramble to unearth the tomb's entrance and secure its
        treasures before they are all lost.
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Each faction races to claim the artifacts inside the tomb, which hold
        the key to accessing the Mechanist Nexus. The first team to capture and
        extract the Tomb Artifact from the center of the battlefield wins. The
        Tomb Artifact is a special objective marker that must be carried to a
        faction's deployment zone.
      </p>
      <h3>Special Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tomb of Secrets:</strong> The Tomb Artifact is hidden in the
          center of the battlefield within a piece of dense terrain (such as a
          crumbling ruin or ancient control room). When any unit enters this
          terrain, they must roll a D6:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>On a 4+, the player finds the Artifact and can pick it up.</li>
          <li>
            On a 1-3, a random malfunction occurs (players roll a D6 for a
            random event):
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Crumbling Terrain:</strong> The terrain becomes difficult
              to move through for the rest of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tech Surge:</strong> A nearby machine becomes active and
              shoots at the unit that touched the artifact, dealing a D6 damage
              to one model in that unit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloak of Darkness:</strong> The unit is disoriented and
              must reroll their next action with a -1 modifier.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Reinforcements:</strong> For this mission, no reserve units
          can be called in. Players must fight with what they deploy at the
          start of the battle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neutral Forces:</strong> There are automated sentries
          patrolling the tomb, which will attack any unit (friend or foe) if
          they come within 6" of them. These sentries are treated as a neutral
          enemy force. They are not controlled by any player but will target the
          nearest unit, following normal targeting rules.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Terrain Suggestions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Shifting Ground:</strong> A large area of the board with
          unstable or shifting terrain that could block movement or line of
          sight at various points. This represents the volatile energy caused by
          the Nexus's awakening.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Damaged Power Relays:</strong> These relays (which are the
          Power Nodes) look like mechanical structures overrun with cables and
          flickering energy. They provide cover but also represent the unstable
          power of the Nexus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ruins of a Fallen City:</strong> Some areas of the battlefield
          are filled with wreckage from long-gone cities, where ancient
          technology remains active.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a name="mission2"><h2>Mission 2: Awakening Threats</h2></a>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The Tomb Artifact has been secured, but the action has caused the
        ancient mechanisms of the tomb to stir to life, triggering environmental
        chaos. The Nexus is beginning to wake, and dangerous, volatile terrain
        has begun to affect the battlefield. The factions are forced to confront
        one another in a skirmish, as the storm of mechanical and environmental
        chaos grows stronger.
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The factions must control specific locations that are connected to the
        Nexus activation. These are Power Nodes that fuel the activation
        process. Each faction wants to control them to prevent their enemies
        from accessing them, or to secure their position for future advantage.
