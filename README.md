# TODO

- change completed-action to past tense, and make it more obvious what the 'new' button does, instead of just duplicate
- only allow unshake button if unit is shaken, hide other buttons. hide 'unshake' unless the unit is shaken. so do more of a replace of all actions
- change "charged" to "was charged", make it not in the same group as the activation actions, as it's a reaction to someone else's action instead
- if multiple things give tough, combine badges
- make each model in a unit have its own HP bar with the weapons it has? That way you can see how much damage each model has taken, and how many weapons are left on the table

# TO FIX

- Add chosen doctrine to army page
- Add command points and underdog points to army page, with +/-
- If shot, and lost enough wounds, prompt for morale, not every activation as it is now
- Max 6 caster tokens ever
- Alex broke shit again - combined allows for single upgrades, so not all doubled weapons
- Victoria's giant model hp bar wrong, only shows the base, not the combined Tough value with the upgrade
