# TODO

- Pull mission info from campaign json
    - probably not worth the effort, especially adding in battle reports
- change completed-action to past tense, and change status to Activated
- only allow unshake button if unit is shaken, hide other buttons
- figure out fatigued status, show what that means
- if multiple things give tough, combine badges
