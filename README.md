# TODO

## Top priority
1. If shot at, and lost wounds. Prompt for morale if under half as usual.
2. Fix available points vs actually used points. This affects the underdog points.
    - Will need to calculate all the total used points for each army, and *then* figure out underdog points and command points.

## High priority
1. Only allow unshake button if unit is shaken, hide other buttons. hide 'unshake' unless the unit is shaken. so do more of a replace of all actions
2. Add command points and underdog points to army page, with +/-
3. Change "charged" to "was charged" and separate from activiation actions. Combine with being shot at morale test from Top #1. 

## Medium priority
1. Add chosen doctrine to army page
2. Change completed-action to past tense, make the new button that appears more obvious what it is for
3. Combined units allows for single model upgrades, doesn't automatically double all weapons
4. Allow players to "cast" a spell 
    - remove the spell tokens needed from the caster
    - remind that *any* caster with 18" can use a spell token to + or - to the roll per token. Ex: friendly caster can +1 to the roll, enemy caster can -1 to the roll
    - remind player to do a spell check, which is 4+ unless other casters spend tokens

## Low priority
1. Make each model in a unit have its own HP bar with the weapons it has? That way you can see how much damage each model has taken, and how many weapons are left on the table
2. Change "unshake" verb to something else, it's not a word
