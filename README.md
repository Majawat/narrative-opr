# TODO

- Pull mission info from campaign json
  - probably not worth the effort, especially adding in battle reports
- change completed-action to past tense, and change status to Activated
- only allow unshake button if unit is shaken, hide other buttons
- figure out fatigued status, show what that means
- if multiple things give tough, combine badges

# TO FIX

- Add chosen doctrine to army page
- Add command points and underdog points to army page, with +/-
- If shot, and lost enough wounds, prompt for morale, not every activation
- Max 6 caster tokens
- Alex broke shit again - combined allows for single upgrades, so not all doubled weapons
- Victoria's giant model hp wrong
