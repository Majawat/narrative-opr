# TODO

- Pull mission info from campaign json
- probably not worth the effort, especially adding in battle reports
- add button for adding caster tokens at start of round for each caster
- change completed-action to past tense, and change status to Activated
- only allow unshake button if unit is shaken, hide other buttons
- figure out fatigued status, show what that means
- fix "morale test required" message to show correct number (is one too high with odd numbers)
